{"name":"MkniXPost","tagline":"Post-processor for MkniX analysis files","body":"## Overview\r\n\r\nMkniXPost is a GUI cross-platform post processor for intrepreting MkniX analyses. MkniX is a code design for the simulation of nonlinear flexible multibody systems, including thermal effects. \r\n\r\n## Characteristics\r\n* Timeline control.\r\n* 3D graphical window with interactive mouse manipulation.\r\n* Rendered surfaces or wire representation of bodies.\r\n* Maps of stress and temperature fields.\r\n* 2D graphs plots of any result (DoF, energy, reactions, etc).\r\n* Image and video capture.\r\n* Stereographic rendering for depth sensing.\r\n* Built on top of cross-platform toolkits (Qt, VTK, gnuplot).\r\n\r\n\r\n![MkniXPost](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daniel-iglesias/mknixpost/master/Examples/capture.jpg)\r\n\r\n![MknixPost Ubuntu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daniel-iglesias/mknixpost/master/Examples/Screenshot-graph.png)\r\n\r\n![MkniXPost Mac OsX](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daniel-iglesias/mknixpost/master/Examples/Captura%20de%20pantalla%202014-07-18%20a%20la%28s%29%2009.38.23.png)\r\n\r\n![MknixPost Windows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daniel-iglesias/mknixpost/master/Examples/Capture%20mknipost%20windows.png)\r\n\r\n## Building and testing\r\n\r\nSee README.md for a description of requirements and procedure for building the MkniX library and using it for creating binary executables.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nMkniXPost is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
